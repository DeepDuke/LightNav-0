# mujoco_demo

A small, self-contained TurtleBot vision-language-navigation simulation
(Python package `vln_mujoco`): it runs
in the fixed MolmoSpaces ProcTHOR 10K validation `val_2` multi-room scene, using
the ceiling MJCF variant, TurtleBot kinematics, and MuJoCo RGB camera rendering,
with a single web page for VLN instructions, live view, WASD driving, emergency
stop, reset, and state readout.

## Highlights

- One scene: only the MolmoSpaces resources actually referenced by
  `val_2_ceiling` are bundled — no full dataset download required;
- One robot: a differential-drive TurtleBot geometry defined in-project, with no
  external meshes;
- One process: Python runs MuJoCo, the web page, and the VLN WebSocket client
  together;
- Pure kinematics: velocity commands are integrated directly into the TurtleBot
  pose — no motors, gravity, or contact dynamics;
- Two views: the web page switches live between the robot's first-person RGB
  and a rear-elevated third-person follow camera;
- On-change state sync: web state is pushed only when the robot, VLN, control
  ownership, or configuration changes;
- VLN semantic feedback: the first-person view shows APOS/OPOS markers, and
  `stop=true` ends the task and releases control automatically;
- MPC control: the same CasADi/IPOPT unicycle MPC, parameters, and
  capture-time pose alignment as `robot_deploy`'s `vln_mpc`;
- No ROS 2, no Node.js, no locomotion policy;
- The web interaction and VLN server protocol are compatible with
  `robot_deploy`'s `vln_web` and `vln_client`.

## Running

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python 3.11+:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8088>. Without a VLN server configured you can still
click **Take control** on the page and drive with WASD. A default server
address can also be set at startup:

```bash
./run.sh --vln-server ws://127.0.0.1:8050
./run.sh --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8088
```

Pressing space or clicking `STOP` on the page zeroes the velocity immediately.
Manual commands also auto-zero when not refreshed for 350 ms.

## Driving it with LightNav-0

Start `lightnav-serve` on a GPU host (see
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)):

```bash
PORT=8050 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 lightnav-serve \
    --task vln --model_path checkpoints/LightNav-0 --backend vllm_local
```

Then paste `ws://<gpu-host>:8050` into the console's **VLN Server WebSocket**
field, type an instruction, and press **Start VLN**. The simulated TurtleBot
streams its first-person frames to the server and tracks the returned waypoints
with the MPC — the same client protocol and controller the real robots use in
[`robot_deploy/`](../robot_deploy/README.md).

The simulation runtime is independent of the bundled TurtleBot embodiment.
Robot implementations satisfy the `RobotBackend` protocol in
`vln_mujoco/robots/base.py`: they provide a MuJoCo model and data, consume the
shared planar velocity command, report pose and velocity, and select the two
render cameras. The runtime continues to own threading, command timeout,
rendering, frame timestamps, and the server-facing snapshot. A new embodiment
therefore does not need to modify the VLN client, MPC, web server, or render
loop.

Body-frame waypoints returned by VLN are first transformed into the world frame
using the robot pose at image-capture time, then tracked by the MPC in the
current robot-local frame. The control rate, horizon, model, cost, constraints,
IPOPT settings, and parameters all match `robot_deploy`'s `vln_mpc`:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| control rate / `horizon` | `10 Hz` / `5` |
| MPC / waypoint `dt` | `0.1 s` / `0.1 s` |
| `track_v_max` / `objnav_v_max` | `1.5 m/s` / `0.8 m/s` |
| `w_max` | `3.0 rad/s` |
| `a_max_v` / `a_max_w` | `2.0 m/s²` / `5.0 rad/s²` |
| `q_x` / `q_y` / `q_yaw` | `10.0` / `10.0` / `1.0` |
| `r_v` / `r_w` | `0.1` / `0.1` |
| IPOPT | `max_iter=100`, `acceptable_tol=1e-8`, `acceptable_obj_change_tol=1e-6` |

## Why a single MolmoSpaces scene is enough

The official MolmoSpaces resource manager installs per scene archive, but
ProcTHOR scene XMLs also reference shared THOR meshes/textures. With the default
MolmoSpaces initialisation flow, the shared THOR object source may be unpacked
in full, so "selecting one scene" does not necessarily mean only that scene's
files end up on disk.

This project runs a pruning script once before release: it parses every `file=`
reference in the fixed scene XML and copies only the meshes/textures inside that
closure, preserving the original directory layout. The current asset closure is
62.4 MiB, so after cloning there is no need for the MolmoSpaces repo or its
downloader.

Developers can regenerate the assets from an existing MolmoSpaces checkout:

```bash
python3 scripts/vendor_molmospaces_scene.py \
  ~/Desktop/molmospaces/assets/scenes/procthor-10k-val/val_2_ceiling.xml
```

The upstream revision, file list, and checksums are recorded in
`vln_mujoco/assets/manifest.json`.

## Known limits

- The TurtleBot is a lightweight geometry drawn for this project, not the
  official high-fidelity TurtleBot3 mesh;
- The spawn pose is fixed at `(x=6.5, y=13.8, yaw=0)` and environment objects
  are frozen;
- RGB only for now, at a camera resolution of `480 × 270`;
- The MPC only tracks the local waypoints provided by VLN — no navigation map,
  global planning, collision response, or ROS interface.
